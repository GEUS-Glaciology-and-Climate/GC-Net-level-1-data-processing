26-Oct-95                  MODEM CONFIGURATIONS

PC208 (PC208E, GT and Telcom) use the first three lines of this file.  PC208
uses the first line to reset the modem into a known state.  The second line
is for the modem initialization string.  Line three is used for additional 
dialing strings such as credit card numbers, etc.  This third line is sent to
the modem before the information in the station file's phone number field.

Nothing else can be put on the first three lines.  If nothing is to be sent
as a reset, you can leave this line blank.  The same applies to the other two
lines.

*** NOTE, there must be a BLANK line to represent each string that has been
omitted. ***

Below is a list of modems and their strings to configure PC208 to work with
high speed modems.  This list was created from customer feedback and by
in-house testing.  The purpose of the list is to help in configuring your
modem.  There is no guarantee that all the modem information is correct.  If
your modem is not listed below, you can try one that you feel is similar,
otherwise consult your PC208 manual for more information.

If you have a modem not on this list and you have put together the strings
that make it work, we welcome any new information.  This also applies to
corrections to the existing list.  Please Mail or FAX the information to:

Use a text editor to either copy your modem's strings to the top of this
file or retype the first three lines with the approprate strings.  If you
copy the strings to the top of the file, remove any leading spaces.
