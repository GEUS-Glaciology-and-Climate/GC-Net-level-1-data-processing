2008

Extended 2008 163 (JUne 12, 2008) --> pulled up with pisten pully at NEEM

2009

(Koni) It took me a while to figure out what happened to the NEEM AWS data set and why I was missing data from JD 95 - 150, 2009.
I plotted the two data set side-by-side and noted that they match when using solar radiation (shortwave reflected radiation), which means the clock did not update properly when the data logger went to sleep on JD 323, 2008 and starting recording again on JD 45, 2009. 

JD 95 hour 04 is JD 150 hour 21 , 2009; the time shift is 55 days 18 hours.

The data set JD 46 hour 23 to JD 95 hour 04, 2009 should be JD 102 hour 17 hours to JD 150 hour 22 hour, 2009.
